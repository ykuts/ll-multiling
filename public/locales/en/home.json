    "subtitle": "An international MedTech company wanted to develop an AI agent that automatically analyzes X-ray and CT images. For this, it needed tens of thousands of precisely labeled images to train the AI agent: a project that would have been too expensive and time-consuming internally. Internal recruitment and training of specialists alone would have taken months. At the same time, there was a lack of scalable processes to provide the data volume with the required quality and speed. And this is exactly where Label Ladder comes in.",
